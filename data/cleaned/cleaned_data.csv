She started out 3rd grade struggling even with 3 letter words and is now reading quite a few basic words. I read recently that 3rd grade is a turning point for kids. Up until then, they are learning to read. After 3rd grade, they read to learn. Kids who can't read at that point have it so much harder. I *do not* want to lose progress over the summer.

We tried ABC Mouse but it wasn't the best. The games for her reading level were geared for younger kids. I've also heard that kids with dyslexia need a different approach to reading.

I'm wondering if you guys can recommend programs that will help her with her reading over the summer. Thanks in advance for any help.",6,17.0,,,,139

My 16 year old daughter was finally diagnosed with Orthographic Dyslexia in 6th grade after many years of tutors and tests etc.  She takes advantage of supports offered by her high school and has a private tutor but is still basically *white-knuckling* it through the academic part of High School.  Luckily, she is flourishing socially and in theater so that's a godsend!

I would like to find her a US college counsellor who can guide her to colleges and programs that might be a good fit for her scholastically.  I'd also like to help her understand ahead of time how she can navigate her first year without burning out or falling behind.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a counselor or resources that have helped your kids navigate this complex and seemly high-stakes system?

It is all like learning another language. I also posted in r/dyslexia and in my search found this site so am posting here as well! My daughter recently had her initial IEP after we expressing concerns to her teacher about her spelling and writing. The school psychologist said they can't diagnosis dyslexia, only make recommendations. The report given to us said '___ scored in the elevated to low range for risk of dyslexia according to the WIAT-III.' I tried googling this but couldn't really figure out what it means.

My question for the community is, what is the benefit of pursuing a dyslexia diagnosis thru her pediatrician? She has been tested and asked so many questions that if it is not needed, I don't want to subject her to more. The IEP identifies areas of need, goals and program accommodations. She will receive 240 minutes weekly of specialized academic instructions.

My second question is, what is the benefit of a tutor specializing in dyslexia? In her most recent report card, she scored as 'standards not met' for writing and conventions of language; 'standard nearly met' for reading literature, reading informational texts, reading foundations and all areas of math; 'standard met' in speaking and listening. In my initial searches on dyslexia, I found local tutors specializing in dyslexia and the Orton-Gillingham Program who will come to our home. The cost is $95/session with 3 sessions minimum a week. From what I've read here, some kids keep tutors for years, with slow improvement. So this a long term commitment. Plus, the tutors only work on their program, no homework. Homework is already a struggle that can be 1+ hours, so adding additional work seems daunting and something our daughter might actively rebel against.

Of course, we want to do everything for her and would willing engage the tutor. My partner is thinking we should give the school and special education teacher a 2 month trial when school resumes again in the fall when the IEP plan will be enacted because 'she's not that far behind'. If no progress is made, then when engage the services of the tutor. Plus, we have an education referral already set up thru her pediatrician we will report her progress to as well. My concern is we are just now starting this whole process and I don't want to waste anymore time. I also feel like a clock is ticking and the older she gets the more rebellious she will get to any help offered. At this time I can get her to play games like Banagrams. I bought a cursive book and she completed a few pages then said she did this in school already and that was enough for her. I get it that she wants her summer off.

As parents we promoted ear-reading daily and encouraged him to use his strong vocabulary even if he doesn’t know how to spell the words. And his teachers never graded him down for incorrect spelling (even when he got 2/10 on spelling tests) and enabled the students to use tools like spell checker.

This has culminated in his 8th grade teacher recognizing him as an outstanding student and encouraging him to take honors English in high school.  

My dad and brother had similar challenges but instead were considered poor students (which makes me so sad - since they had to try harder then their peers to achieve what they did).

My son (8 year old 3rd grader) is in the beginning process of getting evaluated for Dyslexia. He has all the classic signs - late talker, difficulty learning to read, switching directions of letters, switching the order of numbers in math problems, labor intensive writing, poor spelling, avoiding reading aloud, etc... it is pretty clear that he is dyslexic. 

He is extremely bright, but has suffered from a lack of confidence in his intelligence due to the trouble he has had learning to read. My biggest fear is that he will feel even more strongly that he is ""stupid."" OBVIOUSLY, the adults in his life are constantly on the lookout for ways to raise him up and help him understand that he is a smart, wonderful kid. We praise him for his creativity, problem solving, kindness, good attitude, hard work, good deeds... etc. 

I am concerned about how receiving a diagnosis and being sent to the Resource Room might make him feel. How do I approach this with him? How do I explain what dyslexia is and that it doesn't have anything to do with your intellect? Should I prep him for the possibility of his peers judging him?

I was told testing privately could cost up to $10,000. I decided that money was best spent on a specialist to help my child twice a week after school immediately. It’s $120 for 50 minutes. 

In 5th grade, I started to worry about the middle school homework load. So, I wrote letters demanding testing and sent them certified to the principal and the school district. The testing started in 30 days.

Should I have taken this nuclear route to begin with when I knew what the problem was (I’m dyslexic, too)? I don’t know. I know my kid got help either way, even during the pandemic. I don’t know what I would have done if we couldn’t afford private help. 

For me, it was a struggle dealing with teachers acting like I was a crazed tiger mom for thinking my child had a learning disability when they managed okay in class. But managing okay in 2nd or 3rd grade without being able to read isn’t going to lead to competency in high school. 

Fuck all the people who kept saying just read more to your kid at home. We could read to them 24/7 for their entire childhood, and that’s not going to magically cure their dyslexia. It was shifting the blame on to us as parents so they could ignore the issue.

It is also the program currently used in direct instruction in schools throughout the US. OG does not incorporate practice of sight words in the same way other programs, like Lindamood-Bell, do. 

Over the years, reading instruction philosophy within schools has shifted considerably.  There were decades when whole language was touted as the optimal instruction, then sight words, and now we have looped back to phonics based instruction.  In reality, a mix of all is best, but phonics provides the strongest starting foundation and is able to be taught to groups of students. 

Unless you are incredibly committed and able to learn A LOT, I would not recommend solely working with your own child as a means of making progress.  This type of work requires extensive knowledge concerning the basics of language acquisition and the ability to appropriately pace instruction.  Timing while questioning students is also very important to optimize recall.

The most important thing is to be there to support her and remind her that any struggle she experiences with reading is not related to her intelligence. We all have strengths and challenges in life, and this particular challenge will make her a creative thinker and problem solver.  

Most kids with dyslexia test about a year behind even when they have instruction, so don't let the test scores worry you too much.  Most tests used to monitor fluency for kids on IEP's provide one score that is a combination of both rate and accuracy.  Because most people with dyslexia read at a slower rate than people who do not have dyslexia, this means that as soon as rate is factored in, the overall score is pulled down.  That being said, ultimately the goal is to make reading easier, and this is accomplished through specialized instruction first, but then lots and lots of practice.  Read stuff that's high interest for her.  Learning Ally is an excellent resource if you haven't heard about it.  It allows kids to have access to many ebooks, but the platform integrates both visual and audio content, so she can take a break by listening and following along.  It also allows anyone to manipulate the text - from size, to line spacing, which can be very helpful. It can also help kids feel less intimidated about length - they only see a few paragraphs at a time, so they aren't overwhelmed as easily.

,,comment,jdkenb2,,MomWithSkills,1679705847.0,2023-03-25 11:57:27,"Hi, 

As a parent welcome to the journey of having a dyslexic child. It can be frustrating, but also very rewarding, as you support your child and help her on her reading journey.  I've been a dyslexia tutor for 20 years. I got into the field because my son, who is now an adult, was severely dyslexic. (He graduated from college with a BA in literature, so all kinds of things are possible for dyslexic students with the right support.) It sounds like your daughter's  school will be providing specific reading/writing support for her. The question is what type of  support. The gold standard for dyslexia remediation is an Orton-Gillingham based system. (Orton and Gillingham were researchers in the 20th century, who first determined that the way to effectively instruct dyslexic students in reading was to break written English into its smallest component parts and teach it from the ""ground up"" in an explicit, intensive, and repetitious manner.) There are lots of current reading programs available that are descended from  the original Orton-Gillingham system and use the same principles of instruction, such as Wilson Reading, the Barton Reading and Writing System, Lindamood-Bell and many more.) Now-a-days these reading systems incorporate a multi-sensory approach. You didn't describe in your post just how dyslexic your daughter is, since dyslexia is a spectrum disorder ranging from mild-moderate to severe. Therefore, it's hard to say whether whatever instructional assistance the school is providing will be adequate on its own. However, if you decide to hire a private tutor, it's really important to get someone with Orton-Gillingham based training if you want her to see your daughter progress in the most successful way.  Also, to learn more about all aspects of dyslexia check out Susan Barton's website on dyslexia - I think that, like Sally Shaywitz, Barton is one of the best explainers of dyslexia for parents.",2,,vzbhpo,t3_vzbhpo,0.0,312

When she first started school she was hitting all the milestones, but in 3rd grade her reading just stopped progressing.  The school did out of class tutoring but it didn't help at all.  We took her to a specialist to get her diagnosed.

After she was diagnosed we did the tutoring for about 2.5 years.  At first it was 3x week but her last year it was only 2x per week. 

The difference was amazing.  It wasn't all at once, but by the time we started tutoring she had already begun to hate school.  But as she learned to reading strategies and her confidence increased, her attitude changed.  I never realized it, but recently she's told me just how unhappy she was.  

The advantage to her is - she has an official diagnosis for a learning disability and gets accommodations at school.  Extra time on tests, take tests in a separate room with less distractions, not counting off for spelling, that sort of stuff.  Between the tutoring and accommodations she's an A student with occasional Bs, takes AP &amp; honors classes.  And more importantly, her confidence and self-image have vastly improved. She hasn't done OG tutoring for quite a while, but she does have a tutor to help with homework.

Some things to keep in  mind - you have to get a new assessment every 3 years.  Dyslexia never goes away, but ""they"" insist on getting re-evaluated to keep getting accommodations. For my daughter, she is able to read silently just as well as anyone else.  If she needs to read out loud she does still have to practice ahead of time b/c associating sounds with letters is still a challenge.  And her spelling is still atrocious.  Because going the other way (associating letters with sounds) is one of her biggest weaknesses.  With spell check, its not *as big* a problem in high school.   

She'll never not have a learning disability, but she knows she's not ""dumb"" like she used to think.  She knows she can accomplish anything but also knows some things will take her much longer than her friends. And she has strategies to help when she runs into problems.

It's once a week and when my daughter meets (usually during her study hall period) the tutor asks what my daughter wants to work on. 

Daughter was diagnosed with severe dyslexia, so prior to to the OG tutoring she REALLY REALLY struggled.  Reading/writing were pretty much impossible for her.  Obviously we tried to help with school work but we didn't have the background in that situation.  For her at that time I don't think any kind of regular tutoring would have been much value  The OG tutoring gave her a solid foundation to work from.

If your daughter isn't as severe than maybe she won't have the same kind of challenges.  Even if you don't do the OG tutoring (which to be fair is very pricey), maybe getting the diagnosis would help because it will point out the specific areas your daughter struggles with (Dyslexia is a spectrum and different kids have different challenges).  For my daughter her diagnosis was difficulty encoding/decoding letters &amp; sounds.  Which is why she doesn't struggle as much reading silently.  But she still struggles with new words she's not familiar with and have ""odd"" spellings (e.g. silent letters, non-standard pronunciation).  

Knowing her diagnosis though has made it easier for us to figure out how we can help her.  For example, for one of her AP classes we got the audio book version of the textbook.",3,,vlj0tz,t1_ie0ivyc,2.0,248

This was especially true, as he didn't show as behind on standardized tests. It was clearly documented and so we could get addressed even for the areas where he was not falling behind, as he gets older and writing and spelling becomes a bigger part of other subjects.

We do have a tutor, but only once a week and she focuses on getting schoolwork caught up as well as working through his struggles. It was definitely more heavily a clear program for getting caught up where his deficiencies were early on, but had transitioned over the last 4 years. I think a tutor who understands dyslexia and how reading comprehension a totally works is important, but learning the skills to get through actual work has been as big a help as the other items.

I would say finding the right tutor is more important than strictly just a dyslexia focus. Being able to work with your child and find the way to motivate and know when a break or change is needed. My son struggled early on, and while I don't get utter joy when I mention tutoring, he is always ready to go and put in the work she asks of him.

But, they also could not “diagnose “ or even use the word “dyslexia” as a diagnosis back then .  NEver understood that, but it didn’t really matter anyway once we knew what the issue was . 

The diagnosis matters because it is an actual function of her brain . It is how she views and processes information. She needs to know who that she is not dumb or slow or “behind “ so to speak. She is going to have to work harder in the sCHool year and study more . She will have to modify and do things differently than others around her. But it will actually very possibly train her to be ahead of the others around her as she ages . 

Our daughter had to learn to read with special help and she still struggles with spelling etc and is frustrated by it occasionally but she works past it (she is med school now ) (with some accommodations : just extra time on some tests ) . 

As far as the $95 an hour tutoring . I would ask what they do . I’m sure you asked . But… what do they do? 

Our daughter had regular tutors for math and also sometimes for English . For sure for ACT and SAT . 

As far as the special help she got it was at a private school and our state (florida) offers a “McKay scholarship” where they helped pay for some of it . Half I think  of a $10,000 a year total . It was a small Christian school with a program called “the discovery program” . Created by an RN for stroke victims. They do cross body writing and such to get different sides of the brain to develop (or something like that??). She went to that school for two years .

Good luck 

Maybe find a counselor who specializes in this and at least have one visit ?? Or maybe just search around via moms (my main source of help ) and such and just look for any help you can get . See what worked for others locally

The benefit of a formal diagnosis is limited. You get information and the tests a neuropsychologist will administer give good information. It will not qualify you for school based services and in my experience in the US it won’t qualify you for any other supports. The benefit is information.

A tutor who is well trained will be able to provide specific instruction tailored to your child as well as help you navigate the school system to get support. With proper intervention nearly all kids can learn to read.  It is also an added cost and your school SHOULD (this gets really complex) provide intervention.  Even if there isn’t what’s called tier 2 intervention there is a reasonable chance that your child will qualify for an IEP if you’re in the US. Pros of relying on the public school are that it is free.  Cons are that schools do their best but you your school will use the programs they have and group your kid by ability level as well as they can.  With a tutor what you pay for is one on one attention and expertise. With a school you rely on the systemic supports which can be good or not so good depending on the school and the individual teacher.

It’s a 40-hour game-based program that builds the underlying cognitive skills (working memory, processing speed, orthographic processing, etc.), but what made the biggest difference was that our Child finally started to feel succesfull.

Because it’s gamified and self-paced, they didn’t feel “behind” or frustrated every step of the way. They actually *won* at something that had always made them feel defeated. Once the underlying skills improved, their schoolwork started sticking, and that gave them a huge confidence boost.

Two years ago we were stuck in the loop between the school and our doctor trying to get our daughter diagnosed. The school tested her and said she had tendencies, but they said they do not diagnose. The pediatrician said it is the school who would diagnose. I called a child psychologist who did assessments, but she said the school handles dyslexia testing. It was awful and I didn’t know where to turn. We were fortunate enough to find a private therapist at a speech and occupational therapy office who tested for dyslexia. My daughter was tested over two appointments and she was diagnosed with dyslexia. She was what we would call classically dyslexia as far as her test results. It was suggested I read a couple of books, Overcoming Dyslexia was one. I was shocked at how clearly she checked the boxes so to speak after reading just the first chapter.

So thank you for explaining why the school psychologist wouldn’t say she has dyslexia when we had her tested during kindergarten. I urge anyone wanting to have their child tested to do two things….in your IEP meeting request for an evaluation. That gets the ball rolling for services. Second, call around the speech therapist to find one that specializes in OG and have your child privately tested. Those results can be added to your child’s IEP.  I made sure our IEP specifically said she was diagnosed with dyslexia.

It's so wonderful that you are recognizing this when he's so young. If you start his intervention early, you will prevent any potential struggles ahead.

It's not that they don't care, it's just that because they have to work twice as hard as the neuro-typical kid, and don't see results because they are not receiving the right education, they say ""what's the point of trying"". Believe me, just getting through the school day, a Dyslexic child has to put in a whole lot of extra work. They get exhausted. One way to start caring again is to see success. Her educators have to give her tasks that are appropriate for her, meaning that they need to teach her explicitly, systematically, and using a multisensory approach, provide her with ample opportunities to practice new skills, and never ask her to do anything that they have not taught her. She has to be set up for success. Success breeds confidence, and that triggers ownership of the learning process.",1,,smbmkm,t1_ie5x2ir,1.0,155

One example we used is that “regular” brains are like interstates loaded up with Honda Accords.  It’s smooth driving and little maintenance.  **His** brain was like an off road course with a customized off road truck.  His truck simply wasn’t designed for the interstate.  While his brain couldn’t do all the regular easy things, it could do some unique and creative things.

Different does not mean bad!

Help your son find and develop his unique capabilities.  Encourage them not only for his confidence (because it really helps to be good at something besides school), but also because you all might be amazed by the gifts his dyslexia brings.

Try “The Gift of Dyslexia” or some such book to help you understand as well where his strengths and weaknesses might lie.

You need to start getting mentally prepared for the school years ahead.  Be his advocate, his ally, his voice.  Never let dyslexia be an excuse, but understand that he learns differently, processes information differently, and thinks differently.  There are limitations in some areas you will never overcome, so focus on areas where he excels.  (For example, my son was never good at essays, but could give a speech or class presentation and wow the teacher every time.)

Technology is your friend.  Spelling is less important now so please don’t make him memorize spelling words.  He will just forget them.  Get him audiobooks.  Get him started typing now.  Get the school on board with all this and more.

,,comment,hhpqc7v,,_Green_Kyanite_,1634968929.0,2021-10-23 17:02:09,"I think my mom did a fantastic job with me, so here's what she did:

* Any time I called myself stupid, she'd basically say the following: ""Kyanite, am I stupid?"" (no) ""Is your dad stupid?"" (no)  ""Right.  We're smart.  Do smart people have stupid children?"" (no)  ""Right.  We're too smart to have a stupid kid.  So what does that make you?"" ""...smart."" [scary-serious Mom-voice.] ""Say it *louder.""*

* It was also drilled into my head that dyslexia = how you learn.  The problem wasn't me.  The problem was the teachers didn't teach in a way that worked for dyslexic kids.  That's why I had tutors and Special Ed and stuff.  Those people (hypothetically) knew how to teach dyslexic kids.

* She also emphasized that the school *should* have been able to teach me, but public education is run by the government, which only really cares about money.  So they cater to their idea of ""normal"" and basically nobody else.  (That's why my best friend, who is legitimately a genius, had to go to a different school in the second grade.  She finished the entire 1st grade math curriculum before Thanksgiving and instead of teaching her anything new, the teachers just made her redo the same year's worth of worksheets over and over again until she'd literally memorized them.  Her mom wasn't happy, and BFF went to a different school after that.)

* She made it very, very clear it was stupid for schools to lump all the disabled kids together, and basically reiterated her ""the government is cheap"" rant to explain why learning disabled kids get put with the intellectually disabled ones.  (While emphasizing that it would just help each group get their needs met better than the current situation.  Like, it's *not good* that a kid with ADHD and volume control issues might get put in the Resource Room at the same time as a kid who's Autism makes them sensitive to loud noises.)

As for how his peers might judge him...  Honestly, he probably already knows about that.  If there's kids with obvious disabilities in his grade (think Down Syndrome or high-impact Autism) he's watched those kids get sent to the Resource Room since kindergarten.  You start noticing those kids are treated differently by your classmates/teachers around the second or third grade.  (And become *acutely* aware of it if you're in Special Ed.)

That's also where any resistance to going to the Resource Room would come from.  And unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it.  He spent the last four years of his life associating that room with high-impact disabilities.  (High-impact disabilities are more visible and get diagnosed earlier.  So that's who goes to the Resource Room first.)  He knows there's a stigma, and probably doesn't want people to treat him the way they treat people with Down Syndrome.

Instead of trying to keep your son from being upset about the diagnosis and being in Special Ed, I'd actually recommend letting him figure out how he feels about all this, and then adapt your approach around his feelings.  Because if going to the Resource Room will upset him, you can't do or say anything to make it better.  There are a *lot* of very good reasons to be upset about going to the Resource Room.  (It disrupts your schedule.  People treat you differently when they know you're in Special Ed.  Your classmates might tease you when the Special Ed teacher comes to pick you up.  One of the severely disabled kids might ""latch"" onto you as their new best friend and cause problems with your classmates...)

You can obviously tell him that going to the Resource Room shouldn't be embarrassing, or that there's nothing wrong with going there.  But if he's really upset, maybe let him know that he doesn't have to tell anybody about being dyslexic unless he wants to.  Maybe ask the Special Ed teacher to wait outside his classroom until he comes out for his Resource Room period.  That kind of thing.",6,,qdpbf7,t3_qdpbf7,0.0,670

Up until then, they are learning to read. After 3rd grade, they read to learn. Kids who can't read at that point have it so much harder. I *do not* want to lose progress over the summer.

We tried ABC Mouse but it wasn't the best. The games for her reading level were geared for younger kids. I've also heard that kids with dyslexia need a different approach to reading.

I'm wondering if you guys can recommend programs that will help her with her reading over the summer. Thanks in advance for any help.",6,17.0,,,,139

My 16 year old daughter was finally diagnosed with Orthographic Dyslexia in 6th grade after many years of tutors and tests etc.  She takes advantage of supports offered by her high school and has a private tutor but is still basically *white-knuckling* it through the academic part of High School.  Luckily, she is flourishing socially and in theater so that's a godsend!

I would like to find her a US college counsellor who can guide her to colleges and programs that might be a good fit for her scholastically.  I'd also like to help her understand ahead of time how she can navigate her first year without burning out or falling behind.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a counselor or resources that have helped your kids navigate this complex and seemly high-stakes system?

It is all like learning another language. I also posted in r/dyslexia and in my search found this site so am posting here as well! My daughter recently had her initial IEP after we expressing concerns to her teacher about her spelling and writing. The school psychologist said they can't diagnosis dyslexia, only make recommendations. The report given to us said '___ scored in the elevated to low range for risk of dyslexia according to the WIAT-III.' I tried googling this but couldn't really figure out what it means.

My question for the community is, what is the benefit of pursuing a dyslexia diagnosis thru her pediatrician? She has been tested and asked so many questions that if it is not needed, I don't want to subject her to more. The IEP identifies areas of need, goals and program accommodations. She will receive 240 minutes weekly of specialized academic instructions.

My second question is, what is the benefit of a tutor specializing in dyslexia? In her most recent report card, she scored as 'standards not met' for writing and conventions of language; 'standard nearly met' for reading literature, reading informational texts, reading foundations and all areas of math; 'standard met' in speaking and listening. In my initial searches on dyslexia, I found local tutors specializing in dyslexia and the Orton-Gillingham Program who will come to our home. The cost is $95/session with 3 sessions minimum a week. From what I've read here, some kids keep tutors for years, with slow improvement. So this a long term commitment. Plus, the tutors only work on their program, no homework. Homework is already a struggle that can be 1+ hours, so adding additional work seems daunting and something our daughter might actively rebel against.

Of course, we want to do everything for her and would willing engage the tutor. My partner is thinking we should give the school and special education teacher a 2 month trial when school resumes again in the fall when the IEP plan will be enacted because 'she's not that far behind'. If no progress is made, then when engage the services of the tutor. Plus, we have an education referral already set up thru her pediatrician we will report her progress to as well. My concern is we are just now starting this whole process and I don't want to waste anymore time. I also feel like a clock is ticking and the older she gets the more rebellious she will get to any help offered. At this time I can get her to play games like Banagrams. I bought a cursive book and she completed a few pages then said she did this in school already and that was enough for her. I get it that she wants her summer off.

This has culminated in his 8th grade teacher recognizing him as an outstanding student and encouraging him to take honors English in high school.

My son (8 year old 3rd grader) is in the beginning process of getting evaluated for Dyslexia. He has all the classic signs - late talker, difficulty learning to read, switching directions of letters, switching the order of numbers in math problems, labor intensive writing, poor spelling, avoiding reading aloud, etc... it is pretty clear that he is dyslexic. 

He is extremely bright, but has suffered from a lack of confidence in his intelligence due to the trouble he has had learning to read. My biggest fear is that he will feel even more strongly that he is ""stupid."" OBVIOUSLY, the adults in his life are constantly on the lookout for ways to raise him up and help him understand that he is a smart, wonderful kid. We praise him for his creativity, problem solving, kindness, good attitude, hard work, good deeds... etc. 

I am concerned about how receiving a diagnosis and being sent to the Resource Room might make him feel. How do I approach this with him? How do I explain what dyslexia is and that it doesn't have anything to do with your intellect? Should I prep him for the possibility of his peers judging him?

I was told testing privately could cost up to $10,000. I decided that money was best spent on a specialist to help my child twice a week after school immediately. It’s $120 for 50 minutes. 

In 5th grade, I started to worry about the middle school homework load. So, I wrote letters demanding testing and sent them certified to the principal and the school district. The testing started in 30 days.

Should I have taken this nuclear route to begin with when I knew what the problem was (I’m dyslexic, too)? I don’t know. I know my kid got help either way, even during the pandemic. I don’t know what I would have done if we couldn’t afford private help. 

For me, it was a struggle dealing with teachers acting like I was a crazed tiger mom for thinking my child had a learning disability when they managed okay in class. But managing okay in 2nd or 3rd grade without being able to read isn’t going to lead to competency in high school. 

Fuck all the people who kept saying just read more to your kid at home. We could read to them 24/7 for their entire childhood, and that’s not going to magically cure their dyslexia. It was shifting the blame on to us as parents so they could ignore the issue.

It is also the program currently used in direct instruction in schools throughout the US. OG does not incorporate practice of sight words in the same way other programs, like Lindamood-Bell, do. 

Over the years, reading instruction philosophy within schools has shifted considerably.  There were decades when whole language was touted as the optimal instruction, then sight words, and now we have looped back to phonics based instruction.  In reality, a mix of all is best, but phonics provides the strongest starting foundation and is able to be taught to groups of students. 

Unless you are incredibly committed and able to learn A LOT, I would not recommend solely working with your own child as a means of making progress.  This type of work requires extensive knowledge concerning the basics of language acquisition and the ability to appropriately pace instruction.

The most important thing is to be there to support her and remind her that any struggle she experiences with reading is not related to her intelligence. We all have strengths and challenges in life, and this particular challenge will make her a creative thinker and problem solver.  

Most kids with dyslexia test about a year behind even when they have instruction, so don't let the test scores worry you too much.  Most tests used to monitor fluency for kids on IEP's provide one score that is a combination of both rate and accuracy.  Because most people with dyslexia read at a slower rate than people who do not have dyslexia, this means that as soon as rate is factored in, the overall score is pulled down.  That being said, ultimately the goal is to make reading easier, and this is accomplished through specialized instruction first, but then lots and lots of practice.  Read stuff that's high interest for her.  Learning Ally is an excellent resource if you haven't heard about it.  It allows kids to have access to many ebooks, but the platform integrates both visual and audio content, so she can take a break by listening and following along.  It also allows anyone to manipulate the text - from size, to line spacing, which can be very helpful. It can also help kids feel less intimidated about length - they only see a few paragraphs at a time, so they aren't overwhelmed as easily.

,,comment,jdkenb2,,MomWithSkills,1679705847.0,2023-03-25 11:57:27,"Hi, 

As a parent welcome to the journey of having a dyslexic child. It can be frustrating, but also very rewarding, as you support your child and help her on her reading journey.  I've been a dyslexia tutor for 20 years. I got into the field because my son, who is now an adult, was severely dyslexic. (He graduated from college with a BA in literature, so all kinds of things are possible for dyslexic students with the right support.) It sounds like your daughter's  school will be providing specific reading/writing support for her. The question is what type of  support. The gold standard for dyslexia remediation is an Orton-Gillingham based system. (Orton and Gillingham were researchers in the 20th century, who first determined that the way to effectively instruct dyslexic students in reading was to break written English into its smallest component parts and teach it from the ""ground up"" in an explicit, intensive, and repetitious manner.) There are lots of current reading programs available that are descended from  the original Orton-Gillingham system and use the same principles of instruction, such as Wilson Reading, the Barton Reading and Writing System, Lindamood-Bell and many more.) Now-a-days these reading systems incorporate a multi-sensory approach. You didn't describe in your post just how dyslexic your daughter is, since dyslexia is a spectrum disorder ranging from mild-moderate to severe. Therefore, it's hard to say whether whatever instructional assistance the school is providing will be adequate on its own. However, if you decide to hire a private tutor, it's really important to get someone with Orton-Gillingham based training if you want her to see your daughter progress in the most successful way.  Also, to learn more about all aspects of dyslexia check out Susan Barton's website on dyslexia - I think that, like Sally Shaywitz, Barton is one of the best explainers of dyslexia for parents.",2,,vzbhpo,t3_vzbhpo,0.0,312

When she first started school she was hitting all the milestones, but in 3rd grade her reading just stopped progressing.  The school did out of class tutoring but it didn't help at all.  We took her to a specialist to get her diagnosed.

After she was diagnosed we did the tutoring for about 2.5 years.  At first it was 3x week but her last year it was only 2x per week. 

The difference was amazing.  It wasn't all at once, but by the time we started tutoring she had already begun to hate school.  But as she learned to reading strategies and her confidence increased, her attitude changed.  I never realized it, but recently she's told me just how unhappy she was.  

The advantage to her is - she has an official diagnosis for a learning disability and gets accommodations at school.  Extra time on tests, take tests in a separate room with less distractions, not counting off for spelling, that sort of stuff.  Between the tutoring and accommodations she's an A student with occasional Bs, takes AP &amp; honors classes.  And more importantly, her confidence and self-image have vastly improved. She hasn't done OG tutoring for quite a while, but she does have a tutor to help with homework.

Some things to keep in  mind - you have to get a new assessment every 3 years.  Dyslexia never goes away, but ""they"" insist on getting re-evaluated to keep getting accommodations. For my daughter, she is able to read silently just as well as anyone else.  If she needs to read out loud she does still have to practice ahead of time b/c associating sounds with letters is still a challenge.  And her spelling is still atrocious.  Because going the other way (associating letters with sounds) is one of her biggest weaknesses.  With spell check, its not *as big* a problem in high school.   

She'll never not have a learning disability, but she knows she's not ""dumb"" like she used to think.  She knows she can accomplish anything but also knows some things will take her much longer than her friends. And she has strategies to help when she runs into problems.

For us, the testing/tutoring/etc are money and time well spent.  The thing we were worried about is she'd get so far behind she couldn't catch up or that her self-confidence and self-image would be so badly damaged she'd never enjoy school.",5,,vlj0tz,t3_vlj0tz,0.0,413

It's once a week and when my daughter meets (usually during her study hall period) the tutor asks what my daughter wants to work on. 

Daughter was diagnosed with severe dyslexia, so prior to to the OG tutoring she REALLY REALLY struggled.  Reading/writing were pretty much impossible for her.  Obviously we tried to help with school work but we didn't have the background in that situation.  For her at that time I don't think any kind of regular tutoring would have been much value  The OG tutoring gave her a solid foundation to work from.

If your daughter isn't as severe than maybe she won't have the same kind of challenges.  Even if you don't do the OG tutoring (which to be fair is very pricey), maybe getting the diagnosis would help because it will point out the specific areas your daughter struggles with (Dyslexia is a spectrum and different kids have different challenges).  For my daughter her diagnosis was difficulty encoding/decoding letters &amp; sounds.  Which is why she doesn't struggle as much reading silently.  But she still struggles with new words she's not familiar with and have ""odd"" spellings (e.g. silent letters, non-standard pronunciation).  

Knowing her diagnosis though has made it easier for us to figure out how we can help her.  For example, for one of her AP classes we got the audio book version of the textbook.",3,,vlj0tz,t1_ie0ivyc,2.0,248

This was especially true, as he didn't show as behind on standardized tests. It was clearly documented and so we could get addressed even for the areas where he was not falling behind, as he gets older and writing and spelling becomes a bigger part of other subjects.

We do have a tutor, but only once a week and she focuses on getting schoolwork caught up as well as working through his struggles. It was definitely more heavily a clear program for getting caught up where his deficiencies were early on, but had transitioned over the last 4 years. I think a tutor who understands dyslexia and how reading comprehension a totally works is important, but learning the skills to get through actual work has been as big a help as the other items.

I would say finding the right tutor is more important than strictly just a dyslexia focus. Being able to work with your child and find the way to motivate and know when a break or change is needed. My son struggled early on, and while I don't get utter joy when I mention tutoring, he is always ready to go and put in the work she asks of him.

But, they also could not “diagnose “ or even use the word “dyslexia” as a diagnosis back then .  NEver understood that, but it didn’t really matter anyway once we knew what the issue was . 

The diagnosis matters because it is an actual function of her brain . It is how she views and processes information. She needs to know who that she is not dumb or slow or “behind “ so to speak. She is going to have to work harder in the sCHool year and study more . She will have to modify and do things differently than others around her. But it will actually very possibly train her to be ahead of the others around her as she ages . 

Our daughter had to learn to read with special help and she still struggles with spelling etc and is frustrated by it occasionally but she works past it (she is med school now ) (with some accommodations : just extra time on some tests ) . 

As far as the $95 an hour tutoring . I would ask what they do . I’m sure you asked . But… what do they do? 

Our daughter had regular tutors for math and also sometimes for English . For sure for ACT and SAT . 

As far as the special help she got it was at a private school and our state (florida) offers a “McKay scholarship” where they helped pay for some of it . Half I think  of a $10,000 a year total . It was a small Christian school with a program called “the discovery program” . Created by an RN for stroke victims. They do cross body writing and such to get different sides of the brain to develop (or something like that??). She went to that school for two years .

Good luck 

Maybe find a counselor who specializes in this and at least have one visit ?? Or maybe just search around via moms (my main source of help ) and such and just look for any help you can get . See what worked for others locally

The benefit of a formal diagnosis is limited. You get information and the tests a neuropsychologist will administer give good information. It will not qualify you for school based services and in my experience in the US it won’t qualify you for any other supports. The benefit is information.

A tutor who is well trained will be able to provide specific instruction tailored to your child as well as help you navigate the school system to get support. With proper intervention nearly all kids can learn to read.  It is also an added cost and your school SHOULD (this gets really complex) provide intervention.  Even if there isn’t what’s called tier 2 intervention there is a reasonable chance that your child will qualify for an IEP if you’re in the US. Pros of relying on the public school are that it is free.  Cons are that schools do their best but you your school will use the programs they have and group your kid by ability level as well as they can.  With a tutor what you pay for is one on one attention and expertise. With a school you rely on the systemic supports which can be good or not so good depending on the school and the individual teacher.

Because it’s gamified and self-paced, they didn’t feel “behind” or frustrated every step of the way. They actually *won* at something that had always made them feel defeated. Once the underlying skills improved, their schoolwork started sticking, and that gave them a huge confidence boost.

Just be careful about too much switching between programs. They are all constructed slightly differently, teaching things at different points, and it can be confusing to kids. Or they have to start over because they are missing something that is earlier in the new program.

Two years ago we were stuck in the loop between the school and our doctor trying to get our daughter diagnosed. The school tested her and said she had tendencies, but they said they do not diagnose. The pediatrician said it is the school who would diagnose. I called a child psychologist who did assessments, but she said the school handles dyslexia testing. It was awful and I didn’t know where to turn. We were fortunate enough to find a private therapist at a speech and occupational therapy office who tested for dyslexia. My daughter was tested over two appointments and she was diagnosed with dyslexia. She was what we would call classically dyslexia as far as her test results. It was suggested I read a couple of books, Overcoming Dyslexia was one. I was shocked at how clearly she checked the boxes so to speak after reading just the first chapter.

So thank you for explaining why the school psychologist wouldn’t say she has dyslexia when we had her tested during kindergarten. I urge anyone wanting to have their child tested to do two things….in your IEP meeting request for an evaluation. That gets the ball rolling for services. Second, call around the speech therapist to find one that specializes in OG and have your child privately tested. Those results can be added to your child’s IEP.  I made sure our IEP specifically said she was diagnosed with dyslexia.

It's not that they don't care, it's just that because they have to work twice as hard as the neuro-typical kid, and don't see results because they are not receiving the right education, they say ""what's the point of trying"". Believe me, just getting through the school day, a Dyslexic child has to put in a whole lot of extra work. They get exhausted. One way to start caring again is to see success. Her educators have to give her tasks that are appropriate for her, meaning that they need to teach her explicitly, systematically, and using a multisensory approach, provide her with ample opportunities to practice new skills, and never ask her to do anything that they have not taught her. She has to be set up for success. Success breeds confidence, and that triggers ownership of the learning process.",1,,smbmkm,t1_ie5x2ir,1.0,155

One example we used is that “regular” brains are like interstates loaded up with Honda Accords.  It’s smooth driving and little maintenance.  **His** brain was like an off road course with a customized off road truck.  His truck simply wasn’t designed for the interstate.  While his brain couldn’t do all the regular easy things, it could do some unique and creative things.

Different does not mean bad!

Help your son find and develop his unique capabilities.  Encourage them not only for his confidence (because it really helps to be good at something besides school), but also because you all might be amazed by the gifts his dyslexia brings.

Try “The Gift of Dyslexia” or some such book to help you understand as well where his strengths and weaknesses might lie.

You need to start getting mentally prepared for the school years ahead.  Be his advocate, his ally, his voice.  Never let dyslexia be an excuse, but understand that he learns differently, processes information differently, and thinks differently.  There are limitations in some areas you will never overcome, so focus on areas where he excels.  (For example, my son was never good at essays, but could give a speech or class presentation and wow the teacher every time.)

Technology is your friend.  Spelling is less important now so please don’t make him memorize spelling words.  He will just forget them.  Get him audiobooks.  Get him started typing now.  Get the school on board with all this and more.

,,comment,hhpqc7v,,_Green_Kyanite_,1634968929.0,2021-10-23 17:02:09,"I think my mom did a fantastic job with me, so here's what she did:

* Any time I called myself stupid, she'd basically say the following: ""Kyanite, am I stupid?"" (no) ""Is your dad stupid?"" (no)  ""Right.  We're smart.  Do smart people have stupid children?"" (no)  ""Right.  We're too smart to have a stupid kid.  So what does that make you?"" ""...smart."" [scary-serious Mom-voice.] ""Say it *louder.""*

* It was also drilled into my head that dyslexia = how you learn.  The problem wasn't me.  The problem was the teachers didn't teach in a way that worked for dyslexic kids.  That's why I had tutors and Special Ed and stuff.  Those people (hypothetically) knew how to teach dyslexic kids.

* She also emphasized that the school *should* have been able to teach me, but public education is run by the government, which only really cares about money.  So they cater to their idea of ""normal"" and basically nobody else.  (That's why my best friend, who is legitimately a genius, had to go to a different school in the second grade.  She finished the entire 1st grade math curriculum before Thanksgiving and instead of teaching her anything new, the teachers just made her redo the same year's worth of worksheets over and over again until she'd literally memorized them.  Her mom wasn't happy, and BFF went to a different school after that.)

* She made it very, very clear it was stupid for schools to lump all the disabled kids together, and basically reiterated her ""the government is cheap"" rant to explain why learning disabled kids get put with the intellectually disabled ones.  (While emphasizing that it would just help each group get their needs met better than the current situation.  Like, it's *not good* that a kid with ADHD and volume control issues might get put in the Resource Room at the same time as a kid who's Autism makes them sensitive to loud noises.)

As for how his peers might judge him...  Honestly, he probably already knows about that.  If there's kids with obvious disabilities in his grade (think Down Syndrome or high-impact Autism) he's watched those kids get sent to the Resource Room since kindergarten.  You start noticing those kids are treated differently by your classmates/teachers around the second or third grade.  (And become *acutely* aware of it if you're in Special Ed.)

That's also where any resistance to going to the Resource Room would come from.  And unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it.  He spent the last four years of his life associating that room with high-impact disabilities.  (High-impact disabilities are more visible and get diagnosed earlier.  So that's who goes to the Resource Room first.)  He knows there's a stigma, and probably doesn't want people to treat him the way they treat people with Down Syndrome.

Instead of trying to keep your son from being upset about the diagnosis and being in Special Ed, I'd actually recommend letting him figure out how he feels about all this, and then adapt your approach around his feelings.  Because if going to the Resource Room will upset him, you can't do or say anything to make it better.  There are a *lot* of very good reasons to be upset about going to the Resource Room.  (It disrupts your schedule.  People treat you differently when they know you're in Special Ed.  Your classmates might tease you when the Special Ed teacher comes to pick you up.  One of the severely disabled kids might ""latch"" onto you as their new best friend and cause problems with your classmates...)

You can obviously tell him that going to the Resource Room shouldn't be embarrassing, or that there's nothing wrong with going there.  But if he's really upset, maybe let him know that he doesn't have to tell anybody about being dyslexic unless he wants to.  Maybe ask the Special Ed teacher to wait outside his classroom until he comes out for his Resource Room period.  That kind of thing.",6,,qdpbf7,t3_qdpbf7,0.0,670

Up until then, they are learning to read. After 3rd grade, they read to learn. Kids who can't read at that point have it so much harder. I *do not* want to lose progress over the summer.

We tried ABC Mouse but it wasn't the best. The games for her reading level were geared for younger kids. I've also heard that kids with dyslexia need a different approach to reading.

My 16 year old daughter was finally diagnosed with Orthographic Dyslexia in 6th grade after many years of tutors and tests etc.  She takes advantage of supports offered by her high school and has a private tutor but is still basically *white-knuckling* it through the academic part of High School.  Luckily, she is flourishing socially and in theater so that's a godsend!

I would like to find her a US college counsellor who can guide her to colleges and programs that might be a good fit for her scholastically.  I'd also like to help her understand ahead of time how she can navigate her first year without burning out or falling behind.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a counselor or resources that have helped your kids navigate this complex and seemly high-stakes system?

It is all like learning another language. I also posted in r/dyslexia and in my search found this site so am posting here as well! My daughter recently had her initial IEP after we expressing concerns to her teacher about her spelling and writing. The school psychologist said they can't diagnosis dyslexia, only make recommendations. The report given to us said '___ scored in the elevated to low range for risk of dyslexia according to the WIAT-III.' I tried googling this but couldn't really figure out what it means.

My question for the community is, what is the benefit of pursuing a dyslexia diagnosis thru her pediatrician? She has been tested and asked so many questions that if it is not needed, I don't want to subject her to more. The IEP identifies areas of need, goals and program accommodations. She will receive 240 minutes weekly of specialized academic instructions.

My second question is, what is the benefit of a tutor specializing in dyslexia? In her most recent report card, she scored as 'standards not met' for writing and conventions of language; 'standard nearly met' for reading literature, reading informational texts, reading foundations and all areas of math; 'standard met' in speaking and listening. In my initial searches on dyslexia, I found local tutors specializing in dyslexia and the Orton-Gillingham Program who will come to our home. The cost is $95/session with 3 sessions minimum a week. From what I've read here, some kids keep tutors for years, with slow improvement. So this a long term commitment. Plus, the tutors only work on their program, no homework. Homework is already a struggle that can be 1+ hours, so adding additional work seems daunting and something our daughter might actively rebel against.

Of course, we want to do everything for her and would willing engage the tutor. My partner is thinking we should give the school and special education teacher a 2 month trial when school resumes again in the fall when the IEP plan will be enacted because 'she's not that far behind'. If no progress is made, then when engage the services of the tutor. Plus, we have an education referral already set up thru her pediatrician we will report her progress to as well. My concern is we are just now starting this whole process and I don't want to waste anymore time. I also feel like a clock is ticking and the older she gets the more rebellious she will get to any help offered. At this time I can get her to play games like Banagrams. I bought a cursive book and she completed a few pages then said she did this in school already and that was enough for her. I get it that she wants her summer off.

This has culminated in his 8th grade teacher recognizing him as an outstanding student and encouraging him to take honors English in high school.

My son (8 year old 3rd grader) is in the beginning process of getting evaluated for Dyslexia. He has all the classic signs - late talker, difficulty learning to read, switching directions of letters, switching the order of numbers in math problems, labor intensive writing, poor spelling, avoiding reading aloud, etc... it is pretty clear that he is dyslexic. 

He is extremely bright, but has suffered from a lack of confidence in his intelligence due to the trouble he has had learning to read. My biggest fear is that he will feel even more strongly that he is ""stupid."" OBVIOUSLY, the adults in his life are constantly on the lookout for ways to raise him up and help him understand that he is a smart, wonderful kid. We praise him for his creativity, problem solving, kindness, good attitude, hard work, good deeds... etc. 

I am concerned about how receiving a diagnosis and being sent to the Resource Room might make him feel. How do I approach this with him? How do I explain what dyslexia is and that it doesn't have anything to do with your intellect? Should I prep him for the possibility of his peers judging him?

I was told testing privately could cost up to $10,000. I decided that money was best spent on a specialist to help my child twice a week after school immediately. It’s $120 for 50 minutes. 

In 5th grade, I started to worry about the middle school homework load. So, I wrote letters demanding testing and sent them certified to the principal and the school district. The testing started in 30 days.

Should I have taken this nuclear route to begin with when I knew what the problem was (I’m dyslexic, too)? I don’t know. I know my kid got help either way, even during the pandemic. I don’t know what I would have done if we couldn’t afford private help. 

For me, it was a struggle dealing with teachers acting like I was a crazed tiger mom for thinking my child had a learning disability when they managed okay in class. But managing okay in 2nd or 3rd grade without being able to read isn’t going to lead to competency in high school. 

Fuck all the people who kept saying just read more to your kid at home. We could read to them 24/7 for their entire childhood, and that’s not going to magically cure their dyslexia. It was shifting the blame on to us as parents so they could ignore the issue.

It is also the program currently used in direct instruction in schools throughout the US. OG does not incorporate practice of sight words in the same way other programs, like Lindamood-Bell, do. 

Over the years, reading instruction philosophy within schools has shifted considerably.  There were decades when whole language was touted as the optimal instruction, then sight words, and now we have looped back to phonics based instruction.  In reality, a mix of all is best, but phonics provides the strongest starting foundation and is able to be taught to groups of students. 

Unless you are incredibly committed and able to learn A LOT, I would not recommend solely working with your own child as a means of making progress.  This type of work requires extensive knowledge concerning the basics of language acquisition and the ability to appropriately pace instruction.

The most important thing is to be there to support her and remind her that any struggle she experiences with reading is not related to her intelligence. We all have strengths and challenges in life, and this particular challenge will make her a creative thinker and problem solver.  

Most kids with dyslexia test about a year behind even when they have instruction, so don't let the test scores worry you too much.  Most tests used to monitor fluency for kids on IEP's provide one score that is a combination of both rate and accuracy.  Because most people with dyslexia read at a slower rate than people who do not have dyslexia, this means that as soon as rate is factored in, the overall score is pulled down.  That being said, ultimately the goal is to make reading easier, and this is accomplished through specialized instruction first, but then lots and lots of practice.  Read stuff that's high interest for her.  Learning Ally is an excellent resource if you haven't heard about it.  It allows kids to have access to many ebooks, but the platform integrates both visual and audio content, so she can take a break by listening and following along.  It also allows anyone to manipulate the text - from size, to line spacing, which can be very helpful. It can also help kids feel less intimidated about length - they only see a few paragraphs at a time, so they aren't overwhelmed as easily.

As a parent welcome to the journey of having a dyslexic child. It can be frustrating, but also very rewarding, as you support your child and help her on her reading journey.  I've been a dyslexia tutor for 20 years. I got into the field because my son, who is now an adult, was severely dyslexic. (He graduated from college with a BA in literature, so all kinds of things are possible for dyslexic students with the right support.) It sounds like your daughter's  school will be providing specific reading/writing support for her. The question is what type of  support. The gold standard for dyslexia remediation is an Orton-Gillingham based system. (Orton and Gillingham were researchers in the 20th century, who first determined that the way to effectively instruct dyslexic students in reading was to break written English into its smallest component parts and teach it from the ""ground up"" in an explicit, intensive, and repetitious manner.) There are lots of current reading programs available that are descended from  the original Orton-Gillingham system and use the same principles of instruction, such as Wilson Reading, the Barton Reading and Writing System, Lindamood-Bell and many more.) Now-a-days these reading systems incorporate a multi-sensory approach. You didn't describe in your post just how dyslexic your daughter is, since dyslexia is a spectrum disorder ranging from mild-moderate to severe. Therefore, it's hard to say whether whatever instructional assistance the school is providing will be adequate on its own. However, if you decide to hire a private tutor, it's really important to get someone with Orton-Gillingham based training if you want her to see your daughter progress in the most successful way.  Also, to learn more about all aspects of dyslexia check out Susan Barton's website on dyslexia - I think that, like Sally Shaywitz, Barton is one of the best explainers of dyslexia for parents.",2,,vzbhpo,t3_vzbhpo,0.0,312

When she first started school she was hitting all the milestones, but in 3rd grade her reading just stopped progressing.  The school did out of class tutoring but it didn't help at all.  We took her to a specialist to get her diagnosed.

After she was diagnosed we did the tutoring for about 2.5 years.  At first it was 3x week but her last year it was only 2x per week. 

The difference was amazing.  It wasn't all at once, but by the time we started tutoring she had already begun to hate school.  But as she learned to reading strategies and her confidence increased, her attitude changed.  I never realized it, but recently she's told me just how unhappy she was.  

The advantage to her is - she has an official diagnosis for a learning disability and gets accommodations at school.  Extra time on tests, take tests in a separate room with less distractions, not counting off for spelling, that sort of stuff.  Between the tutoring and accommodations she's an A student with occasional Bs, takes AP &amp; honors classes.  And more importantly, her confidence and self-image have vastly improved. She hasn't done OG tutoring for quite a while, but she does have a tutor to help with homework.

Some things to keep in  mind - you have to get a new assessment every 3 years.  Dyslexia never goes away, but ""they"" insist on getting re-evaluated to keep getting accommodations. For my daughter, she is able to read silently just as well as anyone else.  If she needs to read out loud she does still have to practice ahead of time b/c associating sounds with letters is still a challenge.  And her spelling is still atrocious.  Because going the other way (associating letters with sounds) is one of her biggest weaknesses.  With spell check, its not *as big* a problem in high school.   

She'll never not have a learning disability, but she knows she's not ""dumb"" like she used to think.  She knows she can accomplish anything but also knows some things will take her much longer than her friends. And she has strategies to help when she runs into problems.

For us, the testing/tutoring/etc are money and time well spent.  The thing we were worried about is she'd get so far behind she couldn't catch up or that her self-confidence and self-image would be so badly damaged she'd never enjoy school.",5,,vlj0tz,t3_vlj0tz,0.0,413

It's once a week and when my daughter meets (usually during her study hall period) the tutor asks what my daughter wants to work on. 

Daughter was diagnosed with severe dyslexia, so prior to to the OG tutoring she REALLY REALLY struggled.  Reading/writing were pretty much impossible for her.  Obviously we tried to help with school work but we didn't have the background in that situation.  For her at that time I don't think any kind of regular tutoring would have been much value  The OG tutoring gave her a solid foundation to work from.

If your daughter isn't as severe than maybe she won't have the same kind of challenges.  Even if you don't do the OG tutoring (which to be fair is very pricey), maybe getting the diagnosis would help because it will point out the specific areas your daughter struggles with (Dyslexia is a spectrum and different kids have different challenges).  For my daughter her diagnosis was difficulty encoding/decoding letters &amp; sounds.  Which is why she doesn't struggle as much reading silently.  But she still struggles with new words she's not familiar with and have ""odd"" spellings (e.g. silent letters, non-standard pronunciation).  

Knowing her diagnosis though has made it easier for us to figure out how we can help her.  For example, for one of her AP classes we got the audio book version of the textbook.",3,,vlj0tz,t1_ie0ivyc,2.0,248

This was especially true, as he didn't show as behind on standardized tests. It was clearly documented and so we could get addressed even for the areas where he was not falling behind, as he gets older and writing and spelling becomes a bigger part of other subjects.

We do have a tutor, but only once a week and she focuses on getting schoolwork caught up as well as working through his struggles. It was definitely more heavily a clear program for getting caught up where his deficiencies were early on, but had transitioned over the last 4 years. I think a tutor who understands dyslexia and how reading comprehension a totally works is important, but learning the skills to get through actual work has been as big a help as the other items.

I would say finding the right tutor is more important than strictly just a dyslexia focus. Being able to work with your child and find the way to motivate and know when a break or change is needed. My son struggled early on, and while I don't get utter joy when I mention tutoring, he is always ready to go and put in the work she asks of him.

But, they also could not “diagnose “ or even use the word “dyslexia” as a diagnosis back then .  NEver understood that, but it didn’t really matter anyway once we knew what the issue was . 

The diagnosis matters because it is an actual function of her brain . It is how she views and processes information. She needs to know who that she is not dumb or slow or “behind “ so to speak. She is going to have to work harder in the sCHool year and study more . She will have to modify and do things differently than others around her. But it will actually very possibly train her to be ahead of the others around her as she ages . 

Our daughter had to learn to read with special help and she still struggles with spelling etc and is frustrated by it occasionally but she works past it (she is med school now ) (with some accommodations : just extra time on some tests ) . 

As far as the $95 an hour tutoring . I would ask what they do . I’m sure you asked . But… what do they do? 

Our daughter had regular tutors for math and also sometimes for English . For sure for ACT and SAT . 

As far as the special help she got it was at a private school and our state (florida) offers a “McKay scholarship” where they helped pay for some of it . Half I think  of a $10,000 a year total . It was a small Christian school with a program called “the discovery program” . Created by an RN for stroke victims. They do cross body writing and such to get different sides of the brain to develop (or something like that??). She went to that school for two years .

Good luck 

Maybe find a counselor who specializes in this and at least have one visit ?? Or maybe just search around via moms (my main source of help ) and such and just look for any help you can get . See what worked for others locally

The benefit of a formal diagnosis is limited. You get information and the tests a neuropsychologist will administer give good information. It will not qualify you for school based services and in my experience in the US it won’t qualify you for any other supports. The benefit is information.

A tutor who is well trained will be able to provide specific instruction tailored to your child as well as help you navigate the school system to get support. With proper intervention nearly all kids can learn to read.  It is also an added cost and your school SHOULD (this gets really complex) provide intervention.  Even if there isn’t what’s called tier 2 intervention there is a reasonable chance that your child will qualify for an IEP if you’re in the US. Pros of relying on the public school are that it is free.  Cons are that schools do their best but you your school will use the programs they have and group your kid by ability level as well as they can.  With a tutor what you pay for is one on one attention and expertise. With a school you rely on the systemic supports which can be good or not so good depending on the school and the individual teacher.

Because it’s gamified and self-paced, they didn’t feel “behind” or frustrated every step of the way. They actually *won* at something that had always made them feel defeated. Once the underlying skills improved, their schoolwork started sticking, and that gave them a huge confidence boost.

All of the major ones - Lindamood Bell, Wilson, Barton are OG. OG was developed in the 1930's, and everything else is derivative or refinement of the OG concepts. 

Just be careful about too much switching between programs. They are all constructed slightly differently, teaching things at different points, and it can be confusing to kids. Or they have to start over because they are missing something that is earlier in the new program.

Two years ago we were stuck in the loop between the school and our doctor trying to get our daughter diagnosed. The school tested her and said she had tendencies, but they said they do not diagnose. The pediatrician said it is the school who would diagnose. I called a child psychologist who did assessments, but she said the school handles dyslexia testing. It was awful and I didn’t know where to turn. We were fortunate enough to find a private therapist at a speech and occupational therapy office who tested for dyslexia. My daughter was tested over two appointments and she was diagnosed with dyslexia. She was what we would call classically dyslexia as far as her test results. It was suggested I read a couple of books, Overcoming Dyslexia was one. I was shocked at how clearly she checked the boxes so to speak after reading just the first chapter.

So thank you for explaining why the school psychologist wouldn’t say she has dyslexia when we had her tested during kindergarten. I urge anyone wanting to have their child tested to do two things….in your IEP meeting request for an evaluation. That gets the ball rolling for services. Second, call around the speech therapist to find one that specializes in OG and have your child privately tested. Those results can be added to your child’s IEP.  I made sure our IEP specifically said she was diagnosed with dyslexia.

It's so wonderful that you are recognizing this when he's so young. If you start his intervention early, you will prevent any potential struggles ahead.

It's not that they don't care, it's just that because they have to work twice as hard as the neuro-typical kid, and don't see results because they are not receiving the right education, they say ""what's the point of trying"". Believe me, just getting through the school day, a Dyslexic child has to put in a whole lot of extra work. They get exhausted. One way to start caring again is to see success. Her educators have to give her tasks that are appropriate for her, meaning that they need to teach her explicitly, systematically, and using a multisensory approach, provide her with ample opportunities to practice new skills, and never ask her to do anything that they have not taught her. She has to be set up for success. Success breeds confidence, and that triggers ownership of the learning process.",1,,smbmkm,t1_ie5x2ir,1.0,155

One example we used is that “regular” brains are like interstates loaded up with Honda Accords.  It’s smooth driving and little maintenance.  **His** brain was like an off road course with a customized off road truck.  His truck simply wasn’t designed for the interstate.  While his brain couldn’t do all the regular easy things, it could do some unique and creative things.

Different does not mean bad!

Help your son find and develop his unique capabilities.  Encourage them not only for his confidence (because it really helps to be good at something besides school), but also because you all might be amazed by the gifts his dyslexia brings.

Try “The Gift of Dyslexia” or some such book to help you understand as well where his strengths and weaknesses might lie.

You need to start getting mentally prepared for the school years ahead.  Be his advocate, his ally, his voice.  Never let dyslexia be an excuse, but understand that he learns differently, processes information differently, and thinks differently.  There are limitations in some areas you will never overcome, so focus on areas where he excels.  (For example, my son was never good at essays, but could give a speech or class presentation and wow the teacher every time.)

Technology is your friend.  Spelling is less important now so please don’t make him memorize spelling words.  He will just forget them.  Get him audiobooks.  Get him started typing now.  Get the school on board with all this and more.

,,comment,hhpqc7v,,_Green_Kyanite_,1634968929.0,2021-10-23 17:02:09,"I think my mom did a fantastic job with me, so here's what she did:

* Any time I called myself stupid, she'd basically say the following: ""Kyanite, am I stupid?"" (no) ""Is your dad stupid?"" (no)  ""Right.  We're smart.  Do smart people have stupid children?"" (no)  ""Right.  We're too smart to have a stupid kid.  So what does that make you?"" ""...smart."" [scary-serious Mom-voice.] ""Say it *louder.""*

* It was also drilled into my head that dyslexia = how you learn.  The problem wasn't me.  The problem was the teachers didn't teach in a way that worked for dyslexic kids.  That's why I had tutors and Special Ed and stuff.  Those people (hypothetically) knew how to teach dyslexic kids.

* She also emphasized that the school *should* have been able to teach me, but public education is run by the government, which only really cares about money.  So they cater to their idea of ""normal"" and basically nobody else.  (That's why my best friend, who is legitimately a genius, had to go to a different school in the second grade.  She finished the entire 1st grade math curriculum before Thanksgiving and instead of teaching her anything new, the teachers just made her redo the same year's worth of worksheets over and over again until she'd literally memorized them.  Her mom wasn't happy, and BFF went to a different school after that.)

* She made it very, very clear it was stupid for schools to lump all the disabled kids together, and basically reiterated her ""the government is cheap"" rant to explain why learning disabled kids get put with the intellectually disabled ones.  (While emphasizing that it would just help each group get their needs met better than the current situation.  Like, it's *not good* that a kid with ADHD and volume control issues might get put in the Resource Room at the same time as a kid who's Autism makes them sensitive to loud noises.)

As for how his peers might judge him...  Honestly, he probably already knows about that.  If there's kids with obvious disabilities in his grade (think Down Syndrome or high-impact Autism) he's watched those kids get sent to the Resource Room since kindergarten.  You start noticing those kids are treated differently by your classmates/teachers around the second or third grade.  (And become *acutely* aware of it if you're in Special Ed.)

That's also where any resistance to going to the Resource Room would come from.  And unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it.  He spent the last four years of his life associating that room with high-impact disabilities.  (High-impact disabilities are more visible and get diagnosed earlier.  So that's who goes to the Resource Room first.)  He knows there's a stigma, and probably doesn't want people to treat him the way they treat people with Down Syndrome.

Instead of trying to keep your son from being upset about the diagnosis and being in Special Ed, I'd actually recommend letting him figure out how he feels about all this, and then adapt your approach around his feelings.  Because if going to the Resource Room will upset him, you can't do or say anything to make it better.  There are a *lot* of very good reasons to be upset about going to the Resource Room.  (It disrupts your schedule.  People treat you differently when they know you're in Special Ed.  Your classmates might tease you when the Special Ed teacher comes to pick you up.  One of the severely disabled kids might ""latch"" onto you as their new best friend and cause problems with your classmates...)

You can obviously tell him that going to the Resource Room shouldn't be embarrassing, or that there's nothing wrong with going there.  But if he's really upset, maybe let him know that he doesn't have to tell anybody about being dyslexic unless he wants to.  Maybe ask the Special Ed teacher to wait outside his classroom until he comes out for his Resource Room period.  That kind of thing.",6,,qdpbf7,t3_qdpbf7,0.0,670

I’ve tried some guides, but my daughter prefers to just use her finger.  Ask his teacher what they recommend and try some different options to see what they like.  

At home we use the website Epic.  It reads them the story and bolds and makes the word larger as the word being read aloud to them.  It helps the young ones to be read aloud to in my opinion, and this way they see the words in real time as it’s being read to them.",2,,qc4jvl,t3_qc4jvl,0.0,103
